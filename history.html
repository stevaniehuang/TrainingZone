		Here is one of his first ever training lessons, the world-famous <span>Lecture Clash </span>training: <br>
	  <br>
	  Anyone got a lecture clash? They're not pretty, but with your help, they can be manageable.  Here are some thoughts on how to deal with it: </br>
  <ul>
	  <li>Realise that it's up to you. You are responsible for making it work. </li>
		<li>Attend one lecture and get the notes from the other (start with the web notes, but that's not enough).</li>
		<li>Find a friend in the one you miss and get them to tell you what else was covered in class that's not on the web.</li>
		<li>Which one do you miss? - Some ideas to help you with that decision are: </li>
			<ul>
				<li>If you miss one out of two lectures for a subject, that's 50%. If you miss one out of 3 that's 33%. </li>
				<li>Which one are you most on top of? </li>
				<li>Which subject has the most complete lecture notes? </li>
			</ul>
		<li>Don't ask your lecturer - "did I miss anything in the lecture?" If you didn't miss anything, there'd be no point to lectures.</li>
	</ul>
